Of note are that these models performed differently in regards to the f1 & acc score with there being no \"clear\" winner. This showed that the Logistic regression model with the additional features beyond N-grams was capable of identifying false negatives and false positives, whereas the Naive Bayes model was more attuned to True positives and True negatives. Of note is that while the results are of similar scores the performance behind such algorithms differed dramatically, average performance for both logistic regression algorithms was found to be 1m:39.9s whereas Naive Bayes was 1.9s, showing it's dramatically increased performance on the dataset.\n",

    "Seen above in fig #2 I made use of a collection of features that I felt would best show a correlation to the possibility of sarcasm, while also attempint to avoid misidentification on other headlines. To start with, my reasoning as to why I made use of words depicting anger as opposed to sadness or trust due to the likelyhood of such an emotion being used sarcasticly, often in a mocking manner as opposed to other emotions were the correlation might not be as strongly seen. The same reasoning followed for the use of the intensity of said language, with my reasoning being that higher intensity of anger might lead to an increased likelyhood of sarcastic comments appearing in a headline. lastly, I added the feature containing the number of words due to the thought process that short and concise headlines might trend less sarcastic, whereas ones that trial on could increase that likelyhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Conduct an error analysis. For your best perofrming model, select 3 interesting examples that did not work. Indicate why you think they were classified incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instances where errors in classification occured, three interesting examples that I found were \"celebrate older americans month by fighting senior poverty\", \"a different kind of mom \", and \"Your dog died \". For the headline \"celebrate older americans month by fighting senior poverty\" it was misclassified as being sarcastic, likely due to the use of two negative words with an intensity of 1.18 along with vocabulary and form similar to that found in other sarcastic headlines. Next, for the headline \"a different kind of mom\" despite not having negative words it was still predicted as being saracstic, which I think is because of the more casual nature of the headline conforming to a vocabulary that could be considered sarcastic depending on the audience. And lastly for the headline \"your dog died\" which was predicted as not being sarcastic wherein it actually was I believe this was due to its short and matter of fact nature, which contrasts to the average sarcastic headline that might use upwards of a dozen words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. If you could add additional features, what features do you think would help improve performance?\n",
    "    \n",
    "For this model since we're dealing with sarcasm I think having additional features relating to the background or specifications of the source would be benficial. So for example, having a feature that keeps track of the likelyhood of a source providing a sarcastic comment i.e. \"The Onion\" might help prevent the model from misidentifying sarcasm from other sources since nearly all headlines from \"The onion\" are sarcastic. Also features identifying the category of news, such as podcast, scientifc journal, paper, or others sources might increase percision due to differing mehtods in jounralism seen accross mediums. These features would help give additional background context missing from just observing the resulting headlines."
